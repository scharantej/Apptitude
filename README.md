Certainly! Let's walk through designing a Flask application to solve the problem you have provided.

## Overview of the Application
- This Flask application aims to address the problem of managing and displaying inventory items.
- It will feature CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manipulate inventory data.
- The design will include necessary HTML files and Flask routes to implement these functionalities.

### HTML Files
1. **index.html**: This will act as the landing page, displaying all available inventory items.
2. **add_item.html**: This template will facilitate adding new inventory items.
3. **edit_item.html**: This template allows updating existing inventory item details.
4. **delete_item.html**: This template serves as a confirmation page for deleting inventory items.

### Flask Routes
1. **@app.route('/')**: This route serves the `index.html` template, showcasing all inventory items.
2. **@app.route('/add-item')**: This route handles the submission of a new inventory item from the `add_item.html` template.
3. **@app.route('/edit-item/<int:item_id>')**: This route fetches the details of an inventory item by its ID and renders the `edit_item.html` template with those details.
4. **@app.route('/update-item', methods=['POST'])**: This route handles the submission of updated inventory item details.
5. **@app.route('/delete-item/<int:item_id>')**: This route displays a confirmation page for deleting an inventory item, presenting the `delete_item.html` template.
6. **@app.route('/delete-item-action/<int:item_id>', methods=['POST'])**: This route performs the actual deletion of an inventory item from the database.

## Additional Notes
- The HTML files will contain the necessary HTML elements, form fields, and Bootstrap components to create the desired user interface for adding, editing, and deleting items.
- The Flask routes will use the `render_template()` and `redirect()` functions to display the appropriate HTML templates and handle form submissions.
- Data validation and handling (e.g., interacting with a database) will be implemented in the Python code within the Flask routes.
- Integration with a database (e.g., SQLite) will be required to store and manage the inventory items' data.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive design utilizes Flask's capabilities to provide a functional and user-friendly inventory management application. By creating the specified HTML templates and defining the detailed routes, you can implement this application to effectively manage inventory items.
